    Search Interface
</div>

A system that lets you retrieve Wikipedia articles across languages. Your query (source) language can be different from your search results (target) language. In this way, the system ensures that the user has access to information on Wikipedia irrespective of the language the articles are written in.

Relevance: For the growing collection of multi-lingual information available on the internet.
