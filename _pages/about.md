I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at New York University. My interests broadly lie in the application of natural language processing and deep learning methodologies to address privacy issues online. Currently, my research revolves around examining social media platforms to understand the presence of misinformation, conspiratorial content, extremism, and hate speech.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [Atos zData](https://zdatainc.com/), where I developed machine learning and AI-driven data science applications. During my time there, I also got to work on several cool [MLOps](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops) tools.


I have a master’s degree in computer science from Arizona State University and a bachelor’s degree in electronics and communication engineering from National Institute of Technology Delhi. While at ASU, I collaborated with the [Behavioral Research Lab](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/marketing-degrees/research-lab) by implementing technological tools to analyze behavioral patterns. I also had the opportunity to serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for courses such as Principles of International Business and Negotiation at the W. P. Carey School of Business.


During the early part of my career, I worked as a Research and Development Intern for [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about). I rotated within three of their departments -- Arabic Language Technologies, Social Computing, and Visualization.

Outside of my ongoing academic research, I love reading about the [language-cognition relationship](https://www.bu.edu/psych/charris/papers/Encyclopedia.pdf), especially along the [connectionism](https://seop.illc.uva.nl/entries/connectionism/) perspective.
