I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at New York University, advised by [Rachel Greenstadt](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/rachel-greenstadt). I develop computational tools to detect propaganda and disinformation across domains and languages. My research identifies the characteristics of misleading content—for example, detecting persuasive techniques in social media, parliamentary debates, and news articles.

Drawing on my expertise in AI and machine learning, I’m interning at King Street Capital this summer to support investment research. Last summer, I was a VC & ML Fellow at Atento Capital, a Tulsa-based early-stage venture capital firm, where I explored investment evaluation, deal sourcing, and growth strategies while advancing machine learning initiatives across portfolio companies. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Data Scientist at Atos, developing AI-driven applications and implementing MLOps solutions.

I have a master’s degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University and a bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology Delhi. While at ASU, I collaborated with the [Behavioral Research Lab](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/marketing-degrees/research-lab) by implementing technological tools to analyze behavioral patterns. I also had the opportunity to serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for courses such as Principles of International Business and Negotiation at the W. P. Carey School of Business.

During the early part of my career, I worked as a Research and Development Intern for [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri/about). I rotated within three of their departments -- Arabic Language Technologies, Social Computing, and Visualization.

Outside of my ongoing academic research, I'm currently reading about the [language-cognition relationship](https://www.bu.edu/psych/charris/papers/Encyclopedia.pdf), specifically along the [connectionism](https://seop.illc.uva.nl/entries/connectionism/) perspective.
