    - title: Graduate Teaching Assistant
      institution: New York University
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Assisted with and reviewed research proposals for the course Privacy in the Electronic Society

    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: Atos zData
      year: 2020-2022
      description:
        - MLOps- As part of my MLOps work, I containerized applications & deployed them using GCP services & on Kubernetes clusters. Also used KServe (for model inferencing), MLflow (model experimentation and tracking), and Kubeflow pipelines for managing ML workflows. 
        - Entity Extraction- Used a multi-modal deep learning based architecture to extract data from unstructured pdfs.
        - Constrained Optimization- worked on a constrained optimization problem using mixed integer programming. 
        - Retail Video Analytics- Transfer learned a Faster R-CNN based model for object detection. Implemented a deep learning based tracker. 
        - Conversational AI Chatbot- Built a chatbot using Rasa Machine Learning Framework and other external APIs (Google Maps API).
        - PII Detection- Developed a Personally Identifiable Information Detection model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model for custom named entity recognition task. The application can be used to detect & mask sensitive data in text files, including files on GCP buckets. I used Apigee for API management and testing.
        - Worked on a scheduling algorithm that matches members with medical service providers within various radii. I used multiprocessing which saved the firm 40 hours of execution time. I managed GCP compute instances, used cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and used Plotly and Dash framework for developing an interactive web application.

      year: 2019-2020
      description: 
      - I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the course Principles of International Business at W. P. Carey School of Business.
      - As part of my work at the Behavioral Research Lab, I worked on an algorithm that categorized open-ended survey responses into two categories using NLP algorithms for topic extraction.

    - title: Research Intern - Software Engineering
      institution: Qatar Computing Research Institute
      year: 2019-2020
      description: 
      - Worked on developing a new dimensionality reduction technique using tree-indexing.

    - title: Research Intern - Software Engineering
      institution: Qatar Computing Research Institute
      year: 2018 - 2018
      description: 
      - Developed a Multi-Lingual Information Retrieval System that retrieves Wikipedia Articles across languages (French, Arabic and English).
      - Used pre-trained Arabic, French and English word embeddings on monolingual vector spaces.
      - Aligned these monolingual vector spaces using Orthogonal Procrustes Alignment Technique to get a multilingual vector space.
      - Used t-SNE technique for dimensionality reduction and Bokeh for visualization purposes.

    - title: Research Intern - Software Engineering
      institution: Qatar Computing Research Institute
      year: 2017 - 2017
      description: 
      - Analyzed different data sets to understand urban dynamics in fast-growing cities. Worked on a platform for integrating data from disparate physical and social sensors and implemented analytical approaches to mine such data and developed two applications as a result -- One, that visualizes various social demographics of Qatar and the other, an application called QEvents which visualizes various events happening in Qatar through a map-centered dashboard.

    - title: Undergraduate Research
      year: 2015 - 2019
      description:
      - Project 1 - Built a face authenticated and voice-controlled robot that detects objects, and recognizes emotions from facial expressions using deep learning algorithms and models, on Raspberry Pi.
      - Project 2 -  Developed a Sign Language Recognition System (using two approaches â€” sensor-based and image-based)
      - The sensor-based approach involves a glove that converts sign to speech using sensors such as flex sensors, contact sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes, etc.
      - The image-based approach was implemented with the help of Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms.
